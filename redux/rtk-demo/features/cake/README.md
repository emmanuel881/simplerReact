### Importing createSlice from Redux Toolkit

```js
const createSlice = require("@reduxjs/toolkit").createSlice;
```

Here, you're importing the createSlice function from Redux Toolkit. createSlice is a utility function that simplifies the process of defining Redux slices (which include state, reducers, and action creators).

### Defining the Initial State

```js
const initialState = {
  numberOfCakes: 20,
};
```

You define the **initialState** for the slice, which is an object with a single property, **numberOfCakes**, initially set to **20**. This represents the starting state of your application for this specific slice (the "cake" feature).

### Creating the Slice using createSlice

```js
const cakeSlice = createSlice({
  name: "cake",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    ordered: (state, action) => {
      state.numberOfCakes -= action.payload;
    },
    restocked: (state, action) => {
      state.numberOfCakes += action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```

his is the core part of the code. You're using createSlice to generate the Redux logic for a feature called "cake." The createSlice function expects an object with three properties:

- name: A string that names the slice (in this case, "cake"). This is used internally for generating action types like "cake/ordered" and "cake/restocked"
- initialState: The initial state for this slice of the Redux store, which is the initialState object defined earlier.
- reducers: An object where you define functions (reducers) to handle different actions. These

reducers update the state when their corresponding actions are dispatched. In this case:

- ordered: When this action is dispatched, it decreases numberOfCakes by the amount specified in action.payload. This reducer will handle any order of cakes.
- restocked: When this action is dispatched, it increases numberOfCakes by the amount in action.payload, indicating cakes being restocked.

### How createSlice Works

- Action Creators: When you define a reducer inside createSlice, it automatically generates the corresponding action creator for you. For example, for the ordered reducer, an action creator called ordered will be created.
- Mutating State: Normally, Redux reducers require you to return a new state object (since the state should be immutable). However, with Redux Toolkit and createSlice, you can directly mutate the state. Internally, Redux Toolkit uses the immer library, which allows this kind of mutation but treats it immutably under the hood.

### Exporting the Reducer and Actions

```js
module.exports = cakeSlice.reducer;
module.exports.cakeActions = cakeSlice.actions;
```

### Dispatching

if i were to dispatch, here is how the code would look like

```js
// Import the reducer from the file where you created the slice
const { configureStore } = require("@reduxjs/toolkit");
const cakeReducer = require("./path_to_cake_slice_file").cakeActions; // Assuming you saved the slice in a separate file

// Create the store with the cake reducer
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cake: cakeReducer, // Assign the cake slice reducer to the 'cake' key in the state
  },
});

// Now you can dispatch actions
store.dispatch(cakeReducer.ordered(1)); // Dispatch the ordered action
console.log(store.getState()); // Check the state

store.dispatch(cakeReducer.restocked(5)); // Dispatch the restocked action
console.log(store.getState()); // Check the updated state
```
